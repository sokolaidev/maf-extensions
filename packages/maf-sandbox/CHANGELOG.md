## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07

Initial extraction. `maf-sandbox` was split out of a production agent application's sandbox-routing module as the protocol seam between a host application and any sandbox provider: `Sandbox`, `SandboxBackend`, `SandboxKey`, `SandboxSpec`, `WorkspaceContext`, `SandboxRouter`, `SandboxPurger`, and the deployed-isolation rule (`DEPLOYED_ISOLATION`, `SandboxBackendNotPermitted`). This release also adds the publish-ready packaging metadata (license, classifiers, authors, self-contained tool configs) and the import-time experimental notice — no behavioral change to the protocol itself.
