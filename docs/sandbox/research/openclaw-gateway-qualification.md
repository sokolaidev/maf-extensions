# OpenClaw Gateway qualification of the Bicep prototype

> Supervised qualification recorded on 2026-10-03. One Gateway session passed host-path checks with a deterministic provider. The later [shared service design](../openclaw.md) selects the multi-session lifecycle; the shared HTTP prototype was subsequently delivered by #1680; real two-session Gateway acceptance and unattended recovery remain outstanding. The sample README carries the current operator contract.

This records supervised execution on 2026-10-03 in Europe/Amsterdam (UTC+02:00) through the real OpenClaw Gateway and its embedded agent runtime. The combined-candidate acceptance report was written at `2026-10-03T00:40:22+02:00`, equivalent to `2026-10-02T22:40:22Z`. A deterministic local provider selected tools and captured the results sent back to the provider; it was not an LLM and establishes no evidence about model reasoning or prompt-injection resistance. The service used the published dependency pins in the [prototype](../../../samples/experimental/openclaw_bicep/README.md), launched with `uv run --script`. The broader [integration research](openclaw-integration.md) owns the design direction.

## Tested configuration

| Component | Observed version or setting |
|---|---|
| OpenClaw | npm `openclaw@2026.9.7`, CLI revision `c074824` |
| npm package integrity | `sha512-/8N2LnfTFQPvnZizi8qKSFfnLQaPvSG3Cb4xo1YV7b4JhYiUc43ZNRpXJ01bWghLK0Ezk3HVeo/DGHcIRQwRWA==` |
| Host | Windows, Node 26.7.0; Linux Docker guests |
| Bicep image | Local immutable ID `sha256:0bda3505a331713614b847025ce35199f3dda5a81ea2a661130525226dbc0265`; Bicep 0.46.1 (`545b338e2c`) |
| Compiler configuration | `images/bicep-sandbox/prepared.bicepconfig.json`, SHA-256 `d3f160d081dcf48e41f0f0cdf006595b380402ac9730f3ee920738ba616d87e1` |
| Gateway | Separate state, config, home and workspace; loopback port 19761; random bearer token; no channels or plugins; heartbeat disabled |
| Provider | Loopback port 19762, `openai-completions`, deterministic fixture with no external provider calls |
| Tool policy | `tools.allow = ["bicep__bicep_validate"]` |
| MCP | Configured server name `bicep`; stdio; connection timeout 60000 ms; request timeout 240000 ms |

The npm installation used `--ignore-scripts`, followed by OpenClaw's inspected package-local postinstall script; OpenClaw refuses to run before that lifecycle step completes. On the first Windows setup, state operations failed with `OpenClaw state maintenance does not own this database` and an offline-maintenance error. Startup succeeded after using a dedicated process `USERPROFILE` and precreating its `AppData/Local/OpenClaw/locks/openclaw-state-owners` directory and the SQLite parent directory. This is an observed setup workaround, not a proven root-cause diagnosis or a repair instruction for an existing installation. No OpenClaw package source was patched.

## Results

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| CLI discovery | `mcp probe bicep --json` found one server tool, `bicep__bicep_validate`; the host additionally exposed generic resource/prompt helpers from FastMCP's advertised capabilities |
| Gateway routing | `/tools/invoke` returned 404 for the configured MCP tool in this setup; `/v1/chat/completions` reached it through the normal agent runtime |
| Model-facing discovery | OpenClaw presented `tool_search`, `tool_describe` and `tool_call`; the fixture selected the validator through `tool_call` with its exact name |
| Valid source | Completed, valid, status `ok`, confirmed cleanup |
| Type-invalid source | Completed, invalid, status `ok`, confirmed cleanup; compiler diagnostic `BCP033` |
| Uncached registry dependency | Incomplete, null verdict, status `incomplete`, confirmed cleanup; compiler diagnostic `BCP190` |
| Result identity | Source-set digest, exact compiler-config digest and immutable image identity matched the submitted inputs and host configuration |
| Authentication | Both HTTP endpoints returned 401 without the Gateway token |
| Tool policy | Forced `exec` and `bicep__resources_list` requests through `tool_call` were rejected as unknown tool IDs under the explicit allowlist |
| Client disconnect | The checker observed an active Bicep process, closed the HTTP connection, then observed removal of that exact container; another owner's container survived |
| Post-disconnect admission | A subsequent call in the same session returned a completed valid result with confirmed cleanup |
| Resource configuration | Inspection confirmed network mode `none`, 1 GiB memory, one CPU, 128 PIDs and all capabilities dropped |

The reusable checker measured 2.872 seconds from client disconnection to observed exact-container removal; an earlier manual run measured 4.959 seconds. These are polling observations, not a latency guarantee or proof of immediate guest termination. Gateway diagnostics recorded `HTTP client disconnected` and stopped model fallback because the caller signal was aborted. No packet capture verified the intermediate MCP cancellation notification. The service deliberately drains work before disposing resources; a removed container proves its guest processes no longer exist, not the time when the compiler first stopped. The complete acquisition/staging/disposal interruption matrix remains untested.

The first Gateway results contained the diagnostic payload twice in `result.content`: OpenClaw projected `structuredContent` and retained the prototype's compact JSON text mirror. OpenClaw 2026.9.7 removes that mirror only when it matches its two-space JSON representation. The prototype now emits that representation, including literal Unicode. The actual Gateway was rerun after reloading its MCP runtime: all three outcomes produced one projected content item, with the same structured result. A transport regression also covers Unicode. OpenClaw's `details.structuredContent` still carries structured metadata; this is not a claim that the overall model-facing envelope contains the data only once.

The fixture's final response is always `QUALIFICATION_TOOL_RESULT_RECEIVED`; that text alone proves nothing about validation. The checker examines the preceding tool result, expected completion/verdict/status, content count, digests and cleanup. Compiler results arrived inside OpenClaw's external-untrusted-content wrapper. That observation does not establish information-flow enforcement or resistance to malicious diagnostic instructions.

## Session ownership finding

A second Gateway session with the same stdio definition attempted to launch another service against the retained owner directory. The first session still owned its cached MCP runtime, so the second service could not acquire the lock; OpenClaw reported connection closure, no callable tool under the allowlist and HTTP 500. Reusing the original session worked. This is an integration limitation even for a single trusted operator: operator identity does not imply one server process.

The prototype therefore supports one active OpenClaw session per retained owner directory. Do not weaken the lock, delete it or generate untracked owner directories to make another session start. Those changes would break cleanup ownership. [#1665](https://github.com/sokolaidev/maf-extensions/issues/1665) compares a separately supervised loopback Streamable HTTP service with one admission/recovery owner, a host-controlled per-session stdio launcher with durable recovery accounting, and a supported host extension lifecycle. No transport migration is selected or implemented by this qualification.

## Reproduce

Use a fresh, trusted task directory, the prepared image, the current prototype checkout and the pinned OpenClaw installation. Keep the npm cache and temporary files on a volume with sufficient space. Install locally with `npm install --prefix "$TASK_ROOT" --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund --save-exact openclaw@2026.9.7`, then run `node "$TASK_ROOT/node_modules/openclaw/scripts/postinstall-bundled-plugins.mjs"`. Confirm `node "$TASK_ROOT/node_modules/openclaw/openclaw.mjs" --version`. These commands do not install a Gateway service.

Set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` and `OPENCLAW_HOME` to separate paths beneath the task directory. On Windows, set `USERPROFILE` for the Gateway process to its temporary home and precreate the lock directory described above. Preserve the original `USERPROFILE` explicitly in the MCP server's `env` so uv and Docker use the intended runtime configuration. Do not change the machine-wide environment. Set `OPENCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1` and task-local `TEMP`/`TMP`. The MCP launch needs an explicit uv cache location if its parent uses a different home.

Create this dedicated Gateway config, replacing every capitalized placeholder with a trusted local value. All executable and file paths should be absolute. Generate a fresh random bearer token and keep the config outside the agent workspace. The sample command launches published Python dependencies, not workspace editables.

}
```

Run `config validate` and `mcp probe bicep --json` through the local `openclaw.mjs` command before starting the Gateway. The probe initializes the retained owner directory and exits; it must not compete with an already-running service. Start the [fixture provider](../../../tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_provider.py) in a separate terminal:

```bash
uv run python tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_provider.py --evidence "$TASK_ROOT/evidence.jsonl"
```

Start `node "$TASK_ROOT/node_modules/openclaw/openclaw.mjs" gateway run` with the isolated environment and wait for its ready message. Then run the [acceptance checker](../../../tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_check.py) from the repository:

```bash
uv run python tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_check.py \
  --config "$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH" \
  --owner "$BICEP_OWNER_STATE_DIR" \
  --bicep-config images/bicep-sandbox/prepared.bicepconfig.json \
  --image "$BICEP_IMAGE_ID" \
  --evidence "$TASK_ROOT/evidence.jsonl" \
  --report "$TASK_ROOT/acceptance.json" \
  --session qualification
```

Use that same `--session` when repeating the check against a live Gateway. The checker refuses stale success evidence by removing its old report before work, then writes a new report only after every assertion passes. It creates and removes a separately owned temporary Docker container for the disconnect-preservation check. A failure can leave the service's owned resources for its normal recovery path; inspect the dedicated scope and logs rather than running an unscoped cleanup. Stop the Gateway and fixture after checking, and verify that the service's owner scope has no remaining containers.

The evidence file retains tool results and advertised tool names, not the host system prompt, runtime machine identity or bearer token. Keep raw Gateway logs local; they can contain host paths and source snippets. The fixture is a manual test utility, accepts only loopback connections and is not a deployable provider. The local Python unit gate does not run these Gateway acceptance checks automatically.

## HTTP qualification preparation (2026-10-04)

The shared service is merged in [#1680](https://github.com/sokolaidev/maf-extensions/pull/1680). The [HTTP checker](../../../tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_http_check.py) prepares the next bounded part of [#1676](https://github.com/sokolaidev/maf-extensions/issues/1676): two distinct Gateway sessions with valid/invalid/incomplete results, tool-policy denials, one shared admission slot, and a Gateway turn abort whose MCP cancellation is observed at the service. This checker has not yet passed against the real Docker-backed Gateway setup. On this date a bounded read-only Docker health probe timed out. An operator-authorized Desktop restart remained blocked by local VMM socket connection errors; live execution and prior test-resource cleanup remain unconfirmed. The pinned OpenClaw CLI accepted the isolated HTTP configuration, which proves configuration syntax only. The earlier successful SDK/MAF Docker evidence applies to its recorded candidate, not automatically to the merged service or this checker.

Each provider request carries a fresh qualification turn ID, and each result must match exactly one record for that turn and scenario. Both Gateway sessions must map to distinct observed MCP sessions. The [test-only ASGI observer](../../../tests/fixtures/openclaw_http_observer.py) records allowlisted methods, typed request-ID digests, session-ID digests, response status and service counts. It wraps the unchanged Bicep startup composition and HTTP server, forwards messages without rewriting them, and retains no authorization headers, source arguments or response bodies. It adds instrumentation overhead and is not a deployable service feature. Provider result evidence still contains compiler diagnostics; keep it outside the repository.

Use the pinned installation and isolated Gateway/provider setup above, with fresh state for this HTTP run. Start the observer with published dependencies in place of the ordinary service command; select a separate random service credential stored outside the agent workspace:

```bash
uv run --script tests/fixtures/openclaw_http_observer.py \
  --prototype samples/experimental/openclaw_bicep/server.py \
  --image "$BICEP_IMAGE_ID" \
  --config images/bicep-sandbox/prepared.bicepconfig.json \
  --state-dir "$BICEP_OWNER_STATE_DIR" \
  --token-file "$BICEP_TOKEN_FILE" \
  --port 19763 --evidence "$TASK_ROOT/transport.jsonl"
```

This observer pins MAF core 1.19.0 as well as the prototype's published core, Bicep, Docker, MCP and Uvicorn versions. Replace only the dedicated Gateway's `mcp.servers.bicep` entry with a `streamable-http` definition pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:19763/mcp`, using its trusted `headers.Authorization` setting for the service bearer credential and the existing timeouts. Keep Gateway authentication and service authentication separate. Wait for authenticated service readiness, validate the Gateway configuration, start the provider and Gateway, then run:

```bash
uv run python tests/fixtures/openclaw_gateway_http_check.py \
  --config "$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH" --owner "$BICEP_OWNER_STATE_DIR" \
  --bicep-config images/bicep-sandbox/prepared.bicepconfig.json \
  --image "$BICEP_IMAGE_ID" --openclaw "$TASK_ROOT/node_modules/openclaw" \
  --evidence "$TASK_ROOT/evidence.jsonl" \
  --transport-evidence "$TASK_ROOT/transport.jsonl" \
  --report "$TASK_ROOT/http-acceptance.json"
```

The checker creates two fresh Gateway session names per run. Use a fresh dedicated Gateway process when repeating a failed run so cached client runtimes do not accumulate against the eight-session limit. During contention it requires a compiler process still active before aborting and rejects a busy response that fabricated a workload result. Before accepting exact-container removal, it matches the later cancellation notification to the active request and session and requires HTTP 202 from that same HTTP exchange. Natural compiler completion or the provider's fixed final message cannot alone satisfy that check. It creates one separately owned sentinel container and removes that exact resource in its finalizer; failed active work remains under the service's retained recovery owner. Stop the dedicated Gateway, provider and service after checking, and verify the final owner scope is empty and the observer recorded clean shutdown. Do not restart a shared Docker daemon as an implicit fixture cleanup step.

A successful report records candidate/source hashes and dependency versions and deliberately sets `complete_matrix: false`. It covers only the cases above. Gateway runtime disposal, restart/reload without implicit replay, selected service crash and cleanup-failure recovery, and the full transport/MAF matrix on that candidate still need their own execution and evidence. Do not close #1676 based on this report. The offline [evidence tests](../../../tests/test_openclaw_gateway_qualification.py) exercise correlation, identity refusal, redaction, typed cancellation matching and removal of stale success reports; they do not establish live Gateway or Docker acceptance.
